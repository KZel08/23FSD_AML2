## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is integrated into this project to enhance the user interface with responsive design capabilities. It provides a grid system for layout, pre-built components such as the navigation bar and cards, and ensures the website looks consistent across different devices. The dark theme is applied using Bootstrap's built-in theming options.
